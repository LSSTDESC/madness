# MADNESS

Maximum A posteriori with Deep NEural networks for Source Separation

This repository contains the code for the MADNESS project developed within the framework of the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC).
MADNESS obtains the MAP solution to deblend galaxies in a blended scene by performing a gradient descent in a VAE latent space.
