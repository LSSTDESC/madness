# MADNESS

Maximum A posteriori with Deep NEural networks for Source Separation

This repository contains the code for the MADNESS project under development within the framework of the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (LSST DESC).
MADNESS obtains the MAP solution to deblend galaxies in a blended scene by performing gradient descent in a VAE latent space.

A release is being planned soon... 
Till then the package needs to be installed via GitHub

## Installation
For testing the deblender, the package can directly be installed from GitHub
```bash
pip install git+git://github.com/b-biswas/MADNESS.git
```
For contributing (further instructions to be added soon):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/b-biswas/MADNESS/
cd MADNESS
pip install -e .[dev]
```
