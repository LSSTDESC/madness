# MADNESS

Maximum A posteriori with Deep NEural networks for Source Separation

This repository contains the code for the MADNESS project under development within the framework of the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (LSST DESC).
MADNESS obtains the MAP solution to deblend galaxies in a blended scene by performing a gradient descent in a VAE latent space.
